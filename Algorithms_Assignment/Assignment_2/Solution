Algorithm:
1 : find the median of both arrays
2 : compare median if the median are equal then the median of both arrays are same
3 : if median of first array is greater then 
     select arr[0 - n/2] from array A
     select arr[n/2 - n-1] from array B      
4 : if median of second array is greate then the process is vice versa
5 : repeat process until size of both array became 2
6 : if the size of both array are equal then find median using 
     median = (max(A[0],B[0]) + min ( A[1],B[1]))/2
