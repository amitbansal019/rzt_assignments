Fork GIT repository from the following GIT TEST REPO URL and do the following:

Merge “Branch 2” with “Master” and resolve conflicts if any using a pull request.

In “Branch 3”, Revert back your code to “Scene 3 Good Commit” commit.

Create a new branch ‘Branch4’ containing all the files of “Master”.

Create a new file called ‘Bad File’ in Branch4 and commit it locally. Also add few files to git ignore and commit the changes.

Now revert “Bad File” commit and push other changes if any.
